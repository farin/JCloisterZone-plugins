# Additional JCloisterZone plugins



## Spin-off for Two players


## How to build

Nice to have TODO - add maven dependency on JCloisterZone project

For now, JCloisterZone is referenced manually as Eclipse project.
When compiled by IDE, pack plugin to jar

```
cd carcassonne_for_two/
zip -r -9 ../carcassonne_for_two.jar * -x *.java
```
